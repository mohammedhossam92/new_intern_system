━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  🧪 QUICK TESTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TEST 1: Refresh Dashboard
  1. Login with any account
  2. You're now on /dashboard (or /doctor-dashboard, etc.)
  3. Press F5 to refresh

  Expected: ✅ Page reloads smoothly
            ✅ You stay logged in
            ✅ You stay on the same page
            ✅ Brief loading spinner appears
            ❌ NO "Page Not Found" error


TEST 2: Direct URL Access
  1. Login with any account
  2. In address bar, type: /dashboard
  3. Press Enter

  Expected: ✅ Dashboard loads correctly
            ✅ No redirect to signin


TEST 3: Invalid Route (Logged In)
  1. Login
  2. Type in address bar: /some-random-page
  3. Press Enter

  Expected: ✅ Redirects to your role's dashboard
            - Student → /dashboard
            - Doctor → /doctor-dashboard
            - Admin → /admin-dashboard


TEST 4: Invalid Route (Not Logged In)
  1. Logout (or use incognito)
  2. Type in address bar: /some-random-page
  3. Press Enter

  Expected: ✅ Redirects to /signin


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  WHAT YOU'LL SEE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

On Page Refresh:
  1. Brief loading spinner (animated blue circle)
  2. "Loading..." text
  3. Then your dashboard appears

Total time: ~100-300ms (barely noticeable!)


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  FILES CHANGED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ src/App.tsx - Enhanced with loading states
✅ public/_redirects - For Netlify deployment
✅ public/vercel.json - For Vercel deployment


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  HOW IT WORKS NOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before (BROKEN):
  Refresh → Immediately redirect to /signin → Login lost

After (FIXED):
  Refresh → Check auth (show spinner) → Auth confirmed → Stay on page


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  BONUS FEATURES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Works in development (Vite dev server)
✅ Works in production (with included configs)
✅ Works on Netlify (uses _redirects)
✅ Works on Vercel (uses vercel.json)
✅ Loading spinner during auth check
✅ Smart 404 handling
✅ Role-based redirects


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  STILL HAVING ISSUES?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Try:
  1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
  2. Restart dev server (Ctrl+C, then npm run dev)
  3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
  4. Verify localStorage has auth data:
     localStorage.getItem('dental-system-auth')
